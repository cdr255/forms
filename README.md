# Forms

This is my personal collection of forms-mode files.

* **[CDRF-001] Character Details:** Older, more-ttrpg-focused
  character detail sheet. Defines a PC very well in terms of backstory
  and roleplay background.
* **[CDRF-002] Pathfinder PC:** A forms-mode implementation of a
  Pathfinder character sheet. Based off of the Neceros Sheets.
* **[CDRF-003] True 20 PC:** A forms-mode implementation of a True 20
  character sheet. Based off of the official sheet.
* **[CDRF-004] Traveller PC:** A forms-mode implementation of a Classic
  Traveller character sheet. Based off of the official sheet.
* **[CDRF-005] Capes PC:** A forms-mode implementation of _my_ Capes
  RPG character sheet (available as a free PDF on my site).
* **[CDRF-006] Capes Click:** A forms-mode implementation of a blank
  click card for Capes RPG. Fill it out to keep track of homebrew
  clicks.
* **[CDRF-007] PTU PC Trainer:** A forms-mode implementation of the
  Pokémon Tabletop United Trainer character sheet. Based on the
  official sheet.
* **[CDRF-008] PTU PC Pokémon:** A forms-mode implementation of the
  Pokémon Tabletop United Pokémon character sheet. Based on the
  official sheet.
* **[CDRF-009] Character Dossier:** Newer, more-writing-focused
  character detail sheet. Defines a character to excrutiating detail. **(WIP)**
