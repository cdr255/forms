# Forms

This is my personal collection of forms-mode files.

* **[CDRF-001] Character Details:** Older, more-ttrpg-focused
  character detail sheet. Defines a PC very well in terms of backstory
  and roleplay background.
* **[CDRF-002] Pathfinder PC:** A Pathfinder character sheet. Based
  off of the Neceros Sheets.
* **[CDRF-003] True 20 PC:** A True 20 character sheet. Based off of
  the official sheet.
* **[CDRF-004] Traveller PC:** A Classic Traveller character
  sheet. Based off of the official sheet.
* **[CDRF-005] Capes PC:** A forms-mode version of _my_ Capes RPG
  character sheet (available as a free PDF on my site).
* **[CDRF-006] Capes Click:** A blank click card for Capes RPG. Fill
  it out to keep track of homebrew clicks.
* **[CDRF-007] PTU PC Trainer:** A Pokémon Tabletop United Trainer
  character sheet. Based on the official sheet.
* **[CDRF-008] PTU PC Pokémon:** A Pokémon Tabletop United Pokémon
  character sheet. Based on the official sheet.
* **[CDRF-009] Character Dossier:** Newer, more-writing-focused
  character detail sheet. Defines a character to excrutiating
  detail. **(WIP)**
